# Automated tests for [webstore](https://coe-webstore.tdlbox.com/) with selenium

The Automated tests for the web store aims to ensure the functionality, performance, and security of the web store application.
This project based on my project during TDL summer school but here I decided use Selenium instead of Cypress.

Test cases is based on my [test plan](https://tdlschool.atlassian.net/browse/TSS22N-260?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiM2FmMTIxODA3MmU4NDQ1MjkyNTg1NTA5NDM1MzA5ODAiLCJwIjoiaiJ9)
